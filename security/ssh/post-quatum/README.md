# Post-Quantum SSH Key Management

## Overview
Post-quantum cryptography is a critical step in securing digital communications against the potential threats posed by quantum computing. This document outlines the procedures and best practices for implementing post-quantum SSH keys within Syslogine Aegis, ensuring enterprise-grade security and adaptability for the future.

## Purpose
The purpose of this guide is to provide a standard framework for generating, configuring, and managing post-quantum SSH keys. By adhering to these practices, teams and collaborators can ensure compliance with Syslogine Aegis security standards.

## Goals
1. **Future-proof security**: Prepare for the era of quantum computing by adopting resilient cryptographic methods.
2. **Standardization**: Provide consistent implementation practices across all teams and collaborators.
3. **Enterprise-readiness**: Ensure seamless integration of post-quantum SSH within the Syslogine Aegis ecosystem.

## Supported Algorithms
Syslogine Aegis has selected **Dilithium** as the standard for digital signatures due to its robust security, scalability, and industry recognition. Additionally, the following algorithms are supported for specific use cases:

- [**FALCON**](algorithms/falcon.md): Lightweight and efficient digital signatures.
- [**Kyber**](algorithms/kyber.md): High-performance key encapsulation mechanism.
- [**SPHINCS+**](algorithms/sphincs-plus.md): Stateless hash-based signatures for maximum security.
- [**BIKE**](algorithms/bike.md): Compact and efficient key encapsulation.
- [**FrodoKEM**](algorithms/frodo-kem.md): Secure key encapsulation based on LWE.
- [**ED25519**](algorithms/ed25519.md): Efficient elliptic-curve signatures (not post-quantum but widely supported).
- [**Hybrid algorithms**](algorithms/hybrid-algorithms.md): Combining post-quantum and classical methods (e.g., `ECDSA + Dilithium`).

## Components
This guide is divided into three primary sections:

1. **Setup**
    - Generating post-quantum SSH keys using Dilithium.
    - Configuring SSH to use post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.
    - Installing necessary tools.

2. **Usage**
    - Guidelines for integrating post-quantum SSH keys into daily workflows.
    - Troubleshooting common issues.

3. **Maintenance**
    - Rotating keys regularly to mitigate risks.
    - Auditing SSH configurations to ensure compliance with security policies.
