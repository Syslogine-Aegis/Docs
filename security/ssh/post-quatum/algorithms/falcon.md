# FALCON Algorithm for Post-Quantum Cryptography

## Overview
FALCON (Fast Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU) is a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that provides strong security against quantum computing threats. It is efficient, compact, and ideal for systems requiring both high security and limited resource usage.

## Why Use FALCON?
1. **Post-Quantum Security**: Resistant to attacks by quantum computers.
2. **Efficiency**: Optimized for fast computations with small signature sizes.
3. **Compliance**: A finalist in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography competition.

## Key Features
- **Small Signature Sizes**: Typically around 666 bytes for FALCON-512.
- **High Security**: Lattice-based cryptography ensures robustness.
- **Fast Verification**: Optimized for real-time systems.

## Prerequisites
Before implementing FALCON, ensure the following:
1. Access to the [liboqs library](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) for post-quantum cryptographic tools.
2. A compatible system, such as Debian 12.

## Steps to Generate and Use FALCON Keys

### 1. Install Required Tools
Install the necessary libraries and tools to support FALCON:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y liboqs-dev
```
If unavailable, build liboqs from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git
cd liboqs
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make && sudo make install
```

### 2. Generate FALCON Keys
Use `oqs-keygen` to create a FALCON key pair:
```bash
oqs-keygen -a falcon-512 -o ~/.ssh/id_falcon
```
**Explanation:**
- `-a falcon-512`: Specifies the FALCON-512 algorithm.
- `-o ~/.ssh/id_falcon`: Sets the output file for the key pair.

### 3. Protect Your Private Key
Set appropriate permissions to secure your private key:
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_falcon
```

### 4. Configure SSH to Use FALCON
Edit your SSH client configuration to include the FALCON algorithm:
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```
Add the following lines:
```plaintext
Host *
    HostKeyAlgorithms +falcon-512
    PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +falcon-512
```

### 5. Share Your Public Key
Share the public key (`~/.ssh/id_falcon.pub`) with the server administrator to enable access.
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_falcon.pub
```

### 6. Test Your Configuration
Connect to the server using your FALCON key:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_falcon user@hostname
```

## Best Practices
1. Regularly rotate FALCON keys to minimize risks.
2. Store backups of your private key in a secure, encrypted location.
3. Monitor updates to FALCON and liboqs to stay current with security improvements.

## Limitations
- FALCON requires more computational resources for key generation compared to traditional algorithms.
- Adoption is still growing, so compatibility with older systems may be limited.
