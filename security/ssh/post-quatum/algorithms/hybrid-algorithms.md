# Hybrid Algorithms for Post-Quantum Cryptography

## Overview
Hybrid algorithms combine classical cryptographic methods with post-quantum techniques, providing both backward compatibility and quantum resistance. These algorithms are particularly useful during the transition phase to post-quantum security, ensuring interoperability with existing systems.

## Why Use Hybrid Algorithms?
1. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensures continued operation with systems using classical cryptography.
2. **Quantum Resistance**: Adds protection against quantum computing threats.
3. **Gradual Transition**: Allows a phased migration to fully post-quantum cryptographic systems.

## Key Features
- Combines strengths of classical and post-quantum algorithms.
- Flexible configurations for varying levels of security and performance.
- Supported by tools like [Open Quantum Safe](https://openquantumsafe.org/).

## Common Hybrid Configurations
1. **ECDSA + FALCON**: Combines the well-established ECDSA with the post-quantum FALCON algorithm.
2. **RSA + Dilithium**: Merges the security of RSA with the quantum resistance of Dilithium.
3. **ECDH + Kyber**: Ensures secure key exchange with classical ECDH and post-quantum Kyber.

## Prerequisites
Before implementing hybrid algorithms, ensure the following:
1. Access to the [liboqs library](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs).
2. A compatible system, such as Debian 12.

## Steps to Configure Hybrid Algorithms

### 1. Install Required Tools
Install the necessary libraries and tools to support hybrid algorithms:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y liboqs-dev
```
If unavailable, build liboqs from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git
cd liboqs
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make && sudo make install
```

### 2. Generate Hybrid Keys
Use `oqs-keygen` to create hybrid key pairs:

#### Example: ECDSA + FALCON
```bash
oqs-keygen -a ecdsa-falcon-512 -o ~/.ssh/id_hybrid_ecdsa_falcon
```
**Explanation:**
- `-a ecdsa-falcon-512`: Specifies the hybrid ECDSA + FALCON algorithm.
- `-o ~/.ssh/id_hybrid_ecdsa_falcon`: Sets the output file for the key pair.

### 3. Protect Your Private Key
Set appropriate permissions to secure your private key:
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_hybrid_ecdsa_falcon
```

### 4. Configure SSH to Use Hybrid Algorithms
Edit your SSH client configuration to include hybrid algorithms:
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```
Add the following lines:
```plaintext
Host *
    HostKeyAlgorithms +ecdsa-falcon-512
    PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ecdsa-falcon-512
```

### 5. Share Your Public Key
Share the public key (`~/.ssh/id_hybrid_ecdsa_falcon.pub`) with the server administrator to enable access:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_hybrid_ecdsa_falcon.pub
```

### 6. Test Your Configuration
Connect to the server using your hybrid key:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_hybrid_ecdsa_falcon user@hostname
```

## Best Practices
1. Use hybrid algorithms for systems requiring both classical and quantum security.
2. Regularly audit configurations to ensure compliance with the latest standards.
3. Rotate hybrid keys periodically to minimize risks.

## Limitations
- Increased computational overhead compared to standalone algorithms.
- Larger key sizes may impact performance and storage.
- Requires support on both client and server sides for interoperability.
