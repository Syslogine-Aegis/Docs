# Dilithium Algorithm for Post-Quantum Cryptography

## Overview
Dilithium is a lattice-based digital signature algorithm and one of the finalists in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography competition. It offers a strong balance between security, performance, and compatibility, making it a robust choice for enterprise applications.

## Why Use Dilithium?
1. **Post-Quantum Security**: Protects against attacks from quantum computers.
2. **Scalability**: Optimized for high-performance systems.
3. **Compliance**: Recognized as a leading post-quantum algorithm by NIST.

## Key Features
- **Moderate Signature Sizes**: Signature sizes range from 2044 bytes (Dilithium-2) to 3366 bytes (Dilithium-5).
- **High Security**: Based on lattice cryptography, offering resistance to quantum and classical attacks.
- **Efficient Verification**: Ideal for large-scale verification processes.

## Prerequisites
Before implementing Dilithium, ensure the following:
1. Access to the [liboqs library](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) for post-quantum cryptographic tools.
2. A compatible system, such as Debian 12.

## Steps to Generate and Use Dilithium Keys

### 1. Install Required Tools
Install the necessary libraries and tools to support Dilithium:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y liboqs-dev
```
If unavailable, build liboqs from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git
cd liboqs
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make && sudo make install
```

### 2. Generate Dilithium Keys
Use `oqs-keygen` to create a Dilithium key pair:
```bash
oqs-keygen -a dilithium3 -o ~/.ssh/id_dilithium
```
**Explanation:**
- `-a dilithium3`: Specifies the Dilithium-3 algorithm for a balance between security and performance.
- `-o ~/.ssh/id_dilithium`: Sets the output file for the key pair.

### 3. Protect Your Private Key
Set appropriate permissions to secure your private key:
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_dilithium
```

### 4. Configure SSH to Use Dilithium
Edit your SSH client configuration to include the Dilithium algorithm:
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```
Add the following lines:
```plaintext
Host *
    HostKeyAlgorithms +dilithium3
    PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +dilithium3
```

### 5. Share Your Public Key
Share the public key (`~/.ssh/id_dilithium.pub`) with the server administrator to enable access.
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_dilithium.pub
```

### 6. Test Your Configuration
Connect to the server using your Dilithium key:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_dilithium user@hostname
```

## Best Practices
1. Rotate Dilithium keys regularly to maintain security.
2. Store backups of your private key in a secure, encrypted location.
3. Stay updated with new developments in post-quantum cryptography.

## Limitations
- Larger signature sizes compared to classical algorithms like RSA.
- Compatibility with existing systems may require additional configuration.
