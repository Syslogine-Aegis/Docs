# FrodoKEM Algorithm for Post-Quantum Cryptography

## Overview
FrodoKEM is a lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) that uses learning-with-errors (LWE) for strong quantum-resistant security. It is designed for environments requiring robust security and simplicity, albeit with larger key sizes compared to other post-quantum algorithms.

## Why Use FrodoKEM?
1. **Strong Security**: Based on well-studied LWE problems.
2. **Simplicity**: Does not rely on structured lattices, reducing the risk of cryptanalysis breakthroughs.
3. **NIST Recognition**: A prominent candidate in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography competition.

## Key Features
- **High Security**: Suitable for applications where security is prioritized over performance.
- **No Structure Dependency**: Provides a fallback in case structured lattice schemes are compromised.
- **Customizable Parameter Sets**: Offers various levels of security and performance trade-offs.

## Prerequisites
Before implementing FrodoKEM, ensure the following:
1. Access to the [liboqs library](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) for post-quantum cryptographic tools.
2. A compatible system, such as Debian 12.

## Steps to Generate and Use FrodoKEM Keys

### 1. Install Required Tools
Install the necessary libraries and tools to support FrodoKEM:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y liboqs-dev
```
If unavailable, build liboqs from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git
cd liboqs
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make && sudo make install
```

### 2. Generate FrodoKEM Keys
Use `oqs-keygen` to create a FrodoKEM key pair:
```bash
oqs-keygen -a frodokem-640-aes -o ~/.ssh/id_frodokem
```
**Explanation:**
- `-a frodokem-640-aes`: Specifies the FrodoKEM parameter set using AES for enhanced security.
- `-o ~/.ssh/id_frodokem`: Sets the output file for the key pair.

### 3. Protect Your Private Key
Set appropriate permissions to secure your private key:
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_frodokem
```

### 4. Configure SSH to Use FrodoKEM
Edit your SSH client configuration to include the FrodoKEM algorithm:
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```
Add the following lines:
```plaintext
Host *
    HostKeyAlgorithms +frodokem-640-aes
    PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +frodokem-640-aes
```

### 5. Share Your Public Key
Share the public key (`~/.ssh/id_frodokem.pub`) with the server administrator to enable access.
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_frodokem.pub
```

### 6. Test Your Configuration
Connect to the server using your FrodoKEM key:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_frodokem user@hostname
```

## Best Practices
1. Rotate FrodoKEM keys regularly to ensure security.
2. Store backups of your private key securely in an encrypted location.
3. Monitor the latest developments in post-quantum cryptography for updates to FrodoKEM.

## Limitations
- **Larger Key Sizes**: Requires more storage and bandwidth compared to some other post-quantum algorithms.
- **Slower Performance**: Trade-off for its strong security guarantees.
