# BIKE Algorithm for Post-Quantum Cryptography

## Overview
BIKE (Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation) is a post-quantum cryptographic algorithm designed for key encapsulation. It is known for its efficiency and compactness, making it suitable for systems with limited computational resources.

## Why Use BIKE?
1. **Post-Quantum Security**: Provides resilience against quantum computing threats.
2. **Compactness**: Uses smaller ciphertexts and keys compared to some other post-quantum algorithms.
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Designed to operate effectively on systems with constrained resources.

## Key Features
- **Small Key and Ciphertext Sizes**: Minimizes storage and transmission overhead.
- **Based on QC-MDPC Codes**: Uses Quasi-Cyclic Moderate-Density Parity-Check codes for security.
- **Scalable**: Offers different parameter sets for varying levels of security and performance.

## Prerequisites
Before implementing BIKE, ensure the following:
1. Access to the [liboqs library](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) for post-quantum cryptographic tools.
2. A compatible system, such as Debian 12.

## Steps to Generate and Use BIKE Keys

### 1. Install Required Tools
Install the necessary libraries and tools to support BIKE:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y liboqs-dev
```
If unavailable, build liboqs from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git
cd liboqs
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make && sudo make install
```

### 2. Generate BIKE Keys
Use `oqs-keygen` to create a BIKE key pair:
```bash
oqs-keygen -a bike1-l1 -o ~/.ssh/id_bike
```
**Explanation:**
- `-a bike1-l1`: Specifies the BIKE Level 1 parameter set for balanced security and efficiency.
- `-o ~/.ssh/id_bike`: Sets the output file for the key pair.

### 3. Protect Your Private Key
Set appropriate permissions to secure your private key:
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_bike
```

### 4. Configure SSH to Use BIKE
Edit your SSH client configuration to include the BIKE algorithm:
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```
Add the following lines:
```plaintext
Host *
    HostKeyAlgorithms +bike1-l1
    PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +bike1-l1
```

### 5. Share Your Public Key
Share the public key (`~/.ssh/id_bike.pub`) with the server administrator to enable access.
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_bike.pub
```

### 6. Test Your Configuration
Connect to the server using your BIKE key:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_bike user@hostname
```

## Best Practices
1. Rotate BIKE keys periodically to minimize risks.
2. Store backups of your private key securely in an encrypted location.
3. Stay updated with new developments in post-quantum cryptography.

## Limitations
- BIKE requires careful parameter selection to balance security and performance.
- Adoption is growing, but compatibility with legacy systems may be limited.
