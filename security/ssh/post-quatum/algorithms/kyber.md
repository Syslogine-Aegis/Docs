# Kyber Algorithm for Post-Quantum Cryptography

## Overview
Kyber is a lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) that is highly efficient and secure against quantum computing threats. It was selected as a primary encryption algorithm in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization process.

## Why Use Kyber?
1. **Post-Quantum Security**: Protects against quantum attacks.
2. **Efficiency**: Optimized for high-speed operations and low resource consumption.
3. **Flexibility**: Offers multiple parameter sets for varying security and performance needs.

## Key Features
- **Compact Key and Ciphertext Sizes**: Minimal impact on bandwidth and storage.
- **High Performance**: Ideal for applications requiring rapid key exchanges.
- **Standardized**: Selected by NIST for public-key encryption and key encapsulation.

## Prerequisites
Before implementing Kyber, ensure the following:
1. Access to the [liboqs library](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs).
2. A compatible system, such as Debian 12.

## Steps to Generate and Use Kyber Keys

### 1. Install Required Tools
Install the necessary libraries and tools to support Kyber:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y liboqs-dev
```
If unavailable, build liboqs from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git
cd liboqs
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make && sudo make install
```

### 2. Generate Kyber Keys
Use `oqs-keygen` to create a Kyber key pair:
```bash
oqs-keygen -a kyber512 -o ~/.ssh/id_kyber
```
**Explanation:**
- `-a kyber512`: Specifies the Kyber-512 parameter set for a balance between security and performance.
- `-o ~/.ssh/id_kyber`: Sets the output file for the key pair.

### 3. Protect Your Private Key
Set appropriate permissions to secure your private key:
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_kyber
```

### 4. Configure SSH to Use Kyber
Edit your SSH client configuration to include the Kyber algorithm:
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```
Add the following lines:
```plaintext
Host *
    HostKeyAlgorithms +kyber512
    PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +kyber512
```

### 5. Share Your Public Key
Share the public key (`~/.ssh/id_kyber.pub`) with the server administrator to enable access:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_kyber.pub
```

### 6. Test Your Configuration
Connect to the server using your Kyber key:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_kyber user@hostname
```

## Best Practices
1. Rotate Kyber keys periodically to reduce exposure risks.
2. Securely store backups of private keys in encrypted locations.
3. Regularly monitor cryptographic advancements to stay aligned with updated standards.

## Limitations
- Requires compatibility on both client and server for implementation.
- Slightly larger key and ciphertext sizes compared to traditional algorithms.
